    <section class="featured">
        <p>A contest is underway to shape Eurasia's future. Regional powers are putting forward ambitious plans for building roads, railways, pipelines, and other hard infrastructure across the region. These new connections could deepen integration and expand prosperity. They also have the potential to reconfigure relationships, reroute flows of goods and people, and shift power within and between states. But critical questions remain about the feasibility of underlying projects, which face obstacles as big and diverse as the region itself. <b><em>Reconnecting Asia</em></b> is your front row seat to watch whether these visions become reality.</p>
        <p>The maps below illustrate the competing visions of seven leading actors. Based on official documents, each map shows the dominant elements of their continent-crossing initiatives alongside individual projects characteristic of the larger, more complex whole. Collectively, these maps provide an aspirational canvas against which actual progress can be tracked. Click on items below each map to explore individual projects, events, and initiatives in greater detail. Check back as this collection expands to include the visions of more key actors and adds new data to tell this grand story as it unfolds.</p>

        <p>Tokyo's vision stems from long practical experience. Japanese companies have been investing in Southeast Asia for decades, and the structure of the region's infrastructure strongly reflects the needs of their supply chains, especially maintaining access to the sea. Through efforts like its <a href="/database/initiatives/partnership-high-quality-infrastructure/90f84bc6-3fa5-48ae-acdb-ddd5bd606e00/">Partnership for High Quality Infrastructure</a>, which promises to boost regional infrastructure financing by $110 billion over five years, Tokyo has acted swiftly to defend its influence and incumbent advantage. Emphasizing the importance of &ldquo;high-quality and sustainable infrastructure,&rdquo; these efforts also focus on the countries of South Asia, where Japan is promoting the <a href="#">Bay of Bengal Industrial Growth Belt (BIG-B)</a>. Japanese Prime Minister <a href="/database/people/shinzo-abe/aff6fae3-e550-43ba-be6b-abca85c759b3/">Shinzo Abe</a> has also made a point of expanding Tokyo's diplomatic footprint, becoming the first sitting Japanese leader to visit all five countries of Central Asia.</p>

        <p>President <a href="">Park Geun-hye</a>'s <a href="">Eurasian Initiative</a> has OBOR's expansive ambition, incorporating railways from Seoul to the heart of Europe, shipping lanes through the Arctic, enhanced fiber optic networks such as the <a href="">Trans-Eurasian Information Network (TEIN)</a> throughout Southeast Asia, and strengthened bilateral relations with Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, and Mongolia. Beneath this, South Korea's aid strategy mirrors that of Japan, with the activities of its <a href="">Export-Import Bank</a> and <a href="">Economic Development Cooperation Fund</a> focused on enhancing and extending the existing patterns in Southeast Asia's infrastructure. Seoul's vision also accounts for North Korea, featuring both an imagined rail line straight through the demilitarized zone and an alternative undersea route for bypassing the North and connecting directly to Russia's existing rail network.</p>

        <p>While primarily focused on increasing connectivity within its own borders, India is active in some regional integration efforts, including the <a href="">South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC)</a>. Other projects reflect India's geopolitical interests. By developing <a href="">Chabahar Port</a> in Iran, for example, India aims to bypass Pakistan and access overland routes to Europe and Central Asia. Meanwhile, Prime Minister <a href="">Narendra Modi</a>'s &ldquo;Act East&rdquo; policy aims to strengthen links between India and ASEAN nations, in part through projects such as the <a href="">Trilateral Highway</a>, which connects India's Eastern region to Thailand through Myanmar.</p>
