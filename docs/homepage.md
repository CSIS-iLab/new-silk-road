# Homepage Setup

The homepage has been built to include dynamic content, which can be managed via the admin interface.

## Managing the homepage

To manage the stories listed on the homepage, navigate to the [admin](https://reconnectingasia.csis.org/admin). If you
are not logged in, enter your username and password at the prompt. Once logged in, click on "Writings" in the navigation
on the left side of the page. Underneath "Writings" select "Collections". You should now see a list of available
collections. Select "Homepage: Analysis Banner". On the detail page for this collection, you can select articles to
include on the home page. By giving each article a value in the "order" field, you can designate their placement on the
page.

+ The first entry (designated with the lowest number, usually 1) will display in the top of the main column.
+ The second entry will display below the first entry.
+ The third entry will display in the top of the right sidebar.
+ The fourth entry will display below the third entry.

Note: If multiple entries are given the same order, it cannot be guaranteed that they will display consistently.
It's better to use 1, 2, 3, and 4 to ensure that the exact order of entries is consistent.

Note: If more than 4 entries are included in this collection, any beyond the fourth entry will be ignored and will not
display on the homepage.
